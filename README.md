## Getting Started


These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
Basic Library is a solution for the following problem:

- Create a relation between users and books 
- Manage all interactivity via fast ajax calls 
- Integrate the add User functionality via an ajax form 
- Limit books per user to 8 
- (DONE) Please take in account that for the sake of simplicity we assume there is only one copy of every book available
- Implement the Design screens into HTML/CSS supporting modern browsers

### Prerequisites

- Composer
- PHP  >= 5.6
- PDO PHP Extension
- PHPUnit


### Data Importing
You will need to run this command to seed 30 books on the book table.
```
php yii seed
```

### TODO List: according to the time limitation
- Manage a service for error messages
- Unit Test
- code refactoring
